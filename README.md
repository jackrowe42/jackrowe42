- 👋 Hi, I’m @jackrowe42
- 👀 I’m interested in smart home electronics projects.
- 🌱 Self-uneducated, I’m currently learning how to use various sensors, most recently the CO sensor MH-Z19C which so far I have failed to initialize (uncertain about pinouts). Current project includes an ESP32S3 hosting a web page, communicating over Serial with a D1 Mini (esp12F) which in turn uses ESP-now to communicate with various other modules (usually D1 Minis) monitoring temp/humidity, a Cannabis curing room, automatic gate opener and some motion-detecting AI-Thinker ESP32 cams in development. I also have built a windshield-wiper-delay circuit ready to install on an old truck, and a water-level sensor not yet installed on my curing room humidifier. My webpage includes a settings page from where I can change settings such as cure room humidity, rtc time, etc. and turn lights on/off. Both the intermitten-wiper circuit and the humidifier relay circuit include 555 timers as latching flip-flops. 
- 💞️ I’m on the autistic spectrum so am dubious about my ability to collaborate gracefully but am open to such possibilities re: interesting projects, use of components I'm having trouble with (such as MH-Z19C CO sensor) or as a mentor to beginning hobbyists or students (if struggling w/ ESPs, equivalent of "did you turn it off and on again?" would be "more power, please"). I use Arduino IDE for coding so my skills are probably pretty basic though I've been at it on some level since 1994. My first "program" was a 2-line DOS batch file (cd WINDOWS, win.exe) to open my box directly to Windows 3.1 (I think it was?), made me popular in the office when I put it on all the other boxes. FOr my second "program" I changed a DOS prompt to read "Please enter password..."  to lock out an intruder, which worked though it was theoretically bogus (was still just a functioning DOS prompt). 
- 📫 I can be reached via gmail at jckdglsrw, tend to check every 2 - 3 days.
